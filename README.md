#### FAQ

###### Is this stable?
Nope.

###### Does it work?
It does for me.

###### Why don't you write a CMake script to link against an external BreakPad release?
BreakPad release?!

###### Why is the code so ugly?
Because I'm waiting for your pull request to clean it up.

###### Do you actually know what you're doing with all the string conversions?
No.

###### How do I install it?
Not at all right now. It's used as a submodule for now. But it's a high prio to make this packagable as soon as everything works.
